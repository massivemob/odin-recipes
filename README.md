# odin-recipes

This project is about to demonstrate my skills that I have adquired using TheOdinProject, specifically in HTML Foundations.

I want to cover the following elements:

HTML Boilerplate
Paragraphs
Text formatting
Lists
Link and images
Using of GIT

These are the steps I need to assign:

1. Initial structure:
    1. Create an index.html file.
    2. Fill it with a boilerplate.

2. Recipe page:
    1. Create a directory odin-recipes and name it recipes.
    2. Create a new HTML file within the recipes directory and name ir after the recipe it will contain.
        a. Example: lasagna.html
    3. Include an h1 heading with the recipe's name.
    4. Back to index.html, add a link to the recipe page I just created.

3. Recipe page content:
    1. Recipe page should have the following content:
        1. An image of finished dish under the h1 heading I added earlier.
        2. A description using 1 or 2 paragraphs.
        3. Under description, add an "Ingredients" heading followed by unordered list.
        4. Finally, under the ingredients list, add a "Steps" heading followed by an ordered list of the steps needed for making the dish.

4. Add more recipes:
    1. Add two more recipes with identical page structure.
    2. Don't forget to link the new recipes to index page.
        a. Consider to putting all the links in an unordered list.
