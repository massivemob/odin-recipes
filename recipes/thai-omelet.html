        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Thai style omelet (<em>kai jeow</em>) is <b>so easy</b> to make that you can cook it as a last-minute meal or a late night snack. <em>Kai jeow</em> is a pan-fried omelet that is infused with a combination of <em>complex flavors</em>. Kai jeow's sweet, sour, spicy, salty and umami flavor combination is the epitome of Southeast Asian cuisine. When you take your first bite, it will transport you to the streets of Bangkok.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>For the omelet:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs.</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons fish sauce.</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon brown sugar.</li>
            <li>1 scallion, minced.</li>
            <li>1/2 Thai chili to start, minced (optional, can add more if desired).</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>2 to 3 tablespoons vegetable oil.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For serving:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup cooked jasmine rice.</li>
            <li>4 slices cucumber.</li>
            <li>Slices of romaine lettuce.</li>
            <li>Sriracha (optional).</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Step by step</h2>
        <ol>
            <h3><li>Whisk the eggs:</li></h3>
            <dl>
                <dd><p>In a medium bowl, combine the eggs, fish sauce, brown sugar, scallion, Thai chili (if using) and black pepper in a medium bowl. Whisk vigorously until well combined and no egg whites are visible.</p></dd>
            </dl>
            <h3><li>Heat the oil smoking hot:</li></h3>
            <dl>
                <dd><p>Heat vegetable oil in a small (about 8-inch diameter) nonstick skillet over medium-high heat until the oil is hot. You will know when the oil is ready when it smokes lightly.</p></dd>
            </dl>
            <h3><li>Pour the eggs into the hot skillet and cook:</li></h3>
            <dl>
                <dd>
                    <p>Hold the bowl of egg mixture 12 inches above the skillet and pour it into the skillet.</p>
                    
                    <p>The egg will immediately start to fry and become puffy. Cook until lightly browned on the bottom. While you wait, use a small spatula or chopsticks to push the edges of the omelet inward and tilt the pan to encourage the raw eggs in the center to come in contact with the pan. Cook the first side for approximately 3 minutes.</p>

                    <p>Once the omelet is firm, flip the omelet by either flicking your wrist to flip the omelet like a pancake or use a large spatula. Allow it to cook until the other side is browned, approximately 15 seconds.</p>
                </dd>
            </dl>
            <h3><li>Serve:</li></h3>
            <dl>
                <dd><p>Serve immediately with cooked rice, cucumber slices, romaine lettuce, and sriracha (if using). You can create a lettuce wrap with the romaine lettuce if youâ€™d like. In the wrap, you can add cucumber, omelet, and rice.</p></dd>
            </dl>
        </ol>
