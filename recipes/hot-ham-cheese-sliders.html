        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Nothing says comfort like a <b>ham and cheese slider</b>. Up the ante with a <em>seriously</em> mouthwatering compound butter, soft and fluffy slider buns, and plenty of ooey gooey cheese, and you’ve got a meal that your entire family will want over and over again.

            <li>1 (12-count package) Hawaiian slider rolls.</li>
            <li>1/2 pound sliced Swiss cheese, about 12 slices.</li>
            <li>1/2 pound thin-sliced deli ham.</li>

            <dl>
                <dd><p>Using a serrated knife, cut the slider buns through the middle into two halves, dividing the tops and bottoms while keeping each slider bun connected.</p></dd>

            <dl>
                <dd><p>Place the opened rolls on a sheet pan or baking dish, and evenly arrange half the Swiss cheese on the bottom bun.

                <p>Use a spoon or butter knife to smear the softened compound butter all over the tops of the sliders.</p></dd>
